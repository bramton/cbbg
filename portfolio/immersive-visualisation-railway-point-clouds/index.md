# Description
<!--- Situation --->
Point cloud data is three-dimensional by nature, but still the most common way to visualise this data is on a two-dimensional screen. Recent technological advancements within the area of head-mounted displays (HMD) have enabled many new applications across various domains to visualise and interact with 3D data.

<!--- Task/Action --->
Therefore, a working prototype to immersively visualise railway point cloud data was created. The prototype enables the user to load a point cloud scene and interact with the scene using natural hand gestures and voice commands. Manual interactions include scaling, rotating and translating the scene.

<!--- Result/Impact --->
Visualising 3D data in a 3D environments provided an intuitive experience and reduces time to insight.

# Video
The video shows a user interacting with a railway point cloud. The technology used was a HoloLens2.
