# Description
During my master's graduation assignment I explored the potential usage of the finger vein pattern as a biometric trait. All facets where covered during the assignment; sensor design, collection of a dataset, implementation and evaluation of several matching algorithms. The work was presented at the 2013 International Conference on Biometrics[1]. This initial sensor prototype led to several follow-up assignements which improved the sensor design even further.

# Video
The below video shows the Miura et al. repeated line tracking algorithm[2] in action.
