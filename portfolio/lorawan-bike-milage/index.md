# Description
<!--- Situation --->
My love for cycling and engineering led to the creation of this project. As an avid cyclists and data nerd I always enjoy some statistics, like how much I cycled this week. Instead of just resetting my bike computer every Monday, I would like to have an IoT device combined with a fancy web based dashboard instead. This objective was turned into a nice student project. Students from Applied Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://saxion.edu) transformed this idea into a tangible product. 
<!--- Task/Action --->
As a supervisor of this group I was amazed at the self-reliance and professional level of the group. It was truly fun to supervise this group.

<!---  Result/Impact --->
In the end a nice proof of concept was delivered. An IoT device which transmits bike milage over the LoRaWAN network to a centralised server. Data is made available in a dashboard.
