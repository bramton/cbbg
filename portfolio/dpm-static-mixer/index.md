# Description
Imagine opening a box of muesli and finding out it only contains oats. That's a bummer! Most likely, something went wrong in the mixing process. Mixing ingredients of different sizes and densities, such as oats, nuts and raisins is challenging.
Often these dry ingredients are mixed by using a static mixer. To get better insights into which factors influence the mixing process, a Discrete Particle Method (DPM) simulation was performed. 
The simulations were implemented by me using the open source [MercuryDPM](https://www.mercurydpm.org) software package. The visualisation where done using the open source [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org) visualisation engine.

This work was conducted during my stay at the [Wolfson Centre for Bulk Solids Handling](https://www.gre.ac.uk/engsci/research/groups/wolfsoncentre) in England.
