# Description
Road condition monitoring is an expensive endeavour for municipalities and the national government. Condition monitoring is done with dedicated sensing cars. Past research has shown that crowd-sourced smartphone data can be used for condition monitoring[1]. This pilot study looks into the possibility of using smart watches as a complimentory data source. For this project I developed an Android application to log sensing data from the wearable devices in conjunction with location data from the GPS. The results from smartphone based and smart watch based sensing data are compared.
